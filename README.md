#C - Binary trees

This is a group project in which we dive more into data structures and mainly focusing on Binary trees.
We learned about how to qualitfy trees as well as how to traverse them.In the project we have implemented binary,
binary search,AVL and Max Binary heap trees.

## Tests
* [tests](./tests) : A folder for the test files of all tasks, which are provideed by ALX.

## Helper file
* [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c) : C function that prints a binary tree.

##Header File
* [binary_trees.h](./binary_tree.h) : header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and 
functions written in the project.
